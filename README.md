### Learning Goals:

-  Gain a better understanding of fetch requests and use GET, POST, and DELETE with our back end server.
-  Error handle in all aspects of the site - server errors, DOM errors, and user errors included.
-  Learn to organize data without strict guidance and form classes, methods, and tests independently and with careful attention to creating clean, readable code.
-  Use aria states as needed and ensure tabbability and screen reader compliance throughout the page.

### Wins + Challenges:

**Wins:**

I was able to complete all five iterations of a fairly large project and give it my own features and flair.  My user-friendly and attractive UI with robust error handling and full user accessibility was the biggest win for this project.

**Challenges:**

Understanding dynamic fetches was difficult, and being able to use them multiple times and keep an updated Data Model throughout the project was a challenge.  Additionally, this project allowed us the freedom to choose how to organize our data and display it to the user, and it was challenging to build that self confidence and make big decisions.  Overall, my confidence as a developer majorly grew during this project.
